Instructions to Execute and Reproduce Results

## Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook

2. Open the Notebook
- Open `Mobile Price Prediction (ML)-EDA.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.
- Run each cell to reproduce the EDA process and visualizations.

## For the Machine Learning Part

 ## Environment Setup

1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Generate Pickle File

1. **Run Training Script**
python src/train_models.py

This script will:
 -Train seven different machine learning models.
 -Evaluate their performance.
 -Select the best-performing model.
 -Save the best model to a pickle file for later use.

To use the Pickle File
When using the pickle file, ensure you import the train_models.py file to access all the methods of the CellPhoneModel
Refer to the read_pickle.py script for an example of how to load and use the model.
